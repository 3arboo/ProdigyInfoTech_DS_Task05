Traffic Accident Severity Prediction with Machine Learning and Geo-Visualizations

🚗 Exciting Project: Predicting Traffic Accident Severity with ML & Geo-Visualizations! 🌍

Thrilled to announce my latest project as part of my training with Prodigy Info Tech! I've been working on using machine learning to predict the severity of traffic accidents from real-world data.
With advanced modeling and interactive geospatial analysis, I’ve uncovered patterns and potential risk factors that can inform better traffic safety measures.

Key Highlights:

🌐 Developed stunning interactive heatmaps that visualize accident hotspots.

🕒 Performed in-depth analysis of accident trends across different times of day.

🚦 Leveraged the power of RandomForestClassifier to predict accident severity, factoring in conditions like time, traffic signals, and environmental variables.
